# java-diff-report

A simple wrapper for the [java-diff-utils](https://github.com/java-diff-utils/java-diff-utils) library.

The java-diff-report hides the detail of the java-diff-util lib to make it even simpler to use. The java-diff-report accepts 2 input texts, generates the diff information, writes the result into a output file in Markdown format.

The jar is available at

- [Releases page of the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/kazurayam/java-diff-report/releases)
