# java-diff-report

A simple wrapper for the [java-diff-util](https://github.com/java-diff-utils/java-diff-utils) library.

The java-diff-report hides the detail of the java-diff-util lib to make it even simpler to use. The java-diff-report accepts 2 input texts, generates the diff information, writes the result into a output file in Markdown format.
